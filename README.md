# **🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis**

### **📋 Project Overview**
This project aims to build a sentiment analysis pipeline that classifies tweets as **positive** 😊, **negative** 😠, or **neutral** 😐. Currently, the project uses a pre-existing dataset for model training and evaluation. The next stage will enhance the project to analyze **real-time tweets** fetched using the **Twitter Developer API**.

The project involves key **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques like cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming, followed by training machine learning models such as **Naive Bayes**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Logistic Regression**.

### **🚀 Project Status**
- **✅ Current Stage:**
  - Model training, evaluation, and testing completed using a pre-existing dataset.
  - Preliminary visualizations (e.g., word clouds, confusion matrices) completed.
- **🔧 Next Steps:**
  - Integration with **Twitter Developer API** for **real-time data** 🕒.
  - Deploying the project as a **web application** using **Flask** or **Streamlit** for user interaction.
  - Continuous model improvement with live data.
